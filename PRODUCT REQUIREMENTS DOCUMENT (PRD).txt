Positioning

Decision-Support & Risk Awareness Agent (Not a Decision Maker)

1. Product Vision

As AI and technology systems scale, risk increasingly emerges from context, data, and decision authority, not just from models.
RiskLens exists to surface hidden legal, data, and ethical risk signals early, so humans can make better-informed decisions.

RiskLens does not replace experts.
It compresses risk awareness into minutes for learning and discussion.

2. Intended Use (Explicit & Restricted)
✅ Intended For

Research & education

Workshops and learning environments

Early-stage startup exploration

Academic projects

Preliminary VC / PE screening discussions

❌ Not Intended For

Legal advice or compliance certification

Medical or financial decision-making

Regulatory interpretation

Automated approval or rejection

Enforcement or execution

3. Core User Personas

Student / Researcher
Wants to understand risk dimensions of ideas.

Startup Founder (Early Stage)
Wants to avoid blind spots before building or pitching.

University / Innovation Lab
Wants structured discussion around ethics & governance.

VC / PE Analyst (Exploratory)
Wants early risk signals, not legal opinions.

4. Problem Statement

Most AI and tech projects fail due to late discovery of risk, such as:

Privacy violations

Ethical backlash

Regulatory exposure

Automation misuse

Existing approaches are:

Manual

Expert-dependent

Post-deployment

RiskLens shifts risk discovery left (earlier) in the lifecycle.

5. Functional Requirements (Enhanced)
5.1 Input Layer

Accepted Inputs

Free-text project description

Optional PDF / pitch summary

Optional domain selector

Optional geography selector

⚠️ Constraints

No personal data ingestion

No scraping

User-provided inputs only

5.2 Perception & Parsing Layer

Responsibilities

Convert unstructured input → structured representation

Extracts

System purpose

Target users

Data types involved

Level of automation (assistive vs autonomous)

Decision impact level

This layer is the foundation of defensibility.

5.3 Risk Awareness Modules (Advisory Only)

All modules operate on pattern recognition, not legal interpretation.

🔴 Legal Risk Awareness Module

Flags:

Regulatory sensitivity patterns

Liability exposure signals

IP ownership ambiguity

Jurisdictional complexity

Output style

“May involve…”

“Could introduce…”

“Requires expert review…”

❌ Never states violations or compliance.

🟠 Data Risk Awareness Module

Flags:

Personal or sensitive data usage

Consent ambiguity

Data provenance uncertainty

Leakage or misuse potential

Focus: data lifecycle, not data access.

🟡 Ethical Risk Awareness Module

Flags:

Bias amplification risks

Automation overreach

Explainability gaps

Potential human harm

Ethics is framed as discussion-oriented, not enforceable.

5.4 Risk Scoring & Confidence Engine (Enhanced)

Features

Transparent, explainable weighting

Per-module risk scores

Overall risk posture

Confidence indicators

Explicit uncertainty highlighting

⚠️ No “approve / reject” outcomes.

5.5 Report Generation Engine

Produces

Executive summary

Risk table (Legal / Data / Ethical)

Assumptions & limitations

Discussion prompts

Suggested next questions

Language

Neutral

Non-alarmist

Educational

5.6 Human-in-the-Loop Gate (Mandatory)

High-risk flags clearly marked

Human review explicitly required

Override or commentary encouraged

This is a design feature, not a safeguard afterthought.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
Ethics & Safety

Advisory-only

No automation authority

No personal profiling

No platform violations

Transparency

Explainable reasoning

Clear assumptions

Visible limitations

Governance Readiness

Persistent disclaimers

Safe language

Review-first posture

7. Defensibility Strategy (Enhanced)
Intellectual Defensibility

Proprietary risk reasoning frameworks

Modular evaluation logic

Explainable outputs

Workflow Defensibility

Not replaceable by “just prompting GPT”

Structured evaluation loop

Ethical Defensibility

No scraping,

No decisions

Human oversight by design

Regulatory Alignment

Research-only positioning

Safe for regulated domains

8. END-TO-END WORKFLOW
Step 1 — User Input

User submits idea with explicit acknowledgment:

“For research and educational purposes only.”

Step 2 — Context Parsing

Agent extracts system structure and assumptions.

Step 3 — Parallel Risk Analysis

Legal, Data, Ethical modules run independently.

Step 4 — Risk Synthesis

Scores aggregated with confidence indicators.

Step 5 — Report Generation

Structured, readable, discussion-ready output.

Step 6 — Human Review

User interprets, challenges, or refines conclusions.

9. Copilot vs Pilot Positioning
Aspect	RiskLens
Autonomy	Limited
Authority	None
Role	Risk awareness
Execution	Disabled
Oversight	Mandatory

👉 RiskLens is a Copilot for judgment, not a Pilot for action.

10. Success Metrics (Ethical KPIs)

Improved risk understanding

Earlier risk discovery

User trust (not dependency)

Quality of human discussion

11. Mandatory Disclaimer (Every Output)

Disclaimer:
This analysis is provided for research and educational purposes only.
It does not constitute legal, ethical, medical, financial, or regulatory advice.
All conclusions are advisory and require review by qualified human experts.

12. One-Line Positioning (Final)

RiskLens helps people think clearly about risk before decisions are made — for research and education only.
